# AMS Passive Logger CAN Contract v1

## Classification

The original `0x690-0x6B0` stream is passive, read-only telemetry. DER26-CAN-V4 extends the live passive range through `0x6C0`; the original v1 payloads below remain unchanged. Deep tuning payloads `0x6B5..0x6C0` are specified in `AMS_TUNING_CAN_SD_CONTRACT.md`. It exists for the ECU
SD recorder, dashboard/logger nodes, bench analysis, and post-run diagnosis.
It does not control BMS_OK, balancing, charger output, AIRs, watchdog feeding,
or ECU torque authority.

All frames use standard 11-bit identifiers, DLC 8, and big-endian multibyte
fields unless a raw-byte field is explicitly named. The payload definitions in
this file are the original v1 layouts; the live DER26-CAN-V4 logger protocol
version is `4` and the detail snapshot version remains `2`.

## Scheduling and snapshot behavior

The CAN task runs on the 10 Hz fast period. Charger commands have first software
priority, followed by required compact/power frames, advisory frames, and detail.
Every 500 ms it builds all `NSMBS` detail phases from one measurement snapshot:

- Phase zero carries summary frames and the current phase's detailed data.
- Later phases carry the corresponding SMB cell, temperature, masks, and
  diagnostics.
- `0x6AD` identifies snapshot version, logger sequence, phase, phase count, and
  the source measurement sequence.
- Both single-SMB and five-SMB builds publish a complete base snapshot at 2 Hz.
- All phases are queued together and drain asynchronously through mailbox
  interrupts; they are not spread across five task cycles.

The active detail generation runs to completion. A newer base snapshot can
replace the pending generation. Fast tuning can replace pending tuning, but is
shed when a base snapshot is pending; `can diag` reports `CAN tuning shed`.
Required/protected traffic is always selected before detail. Bus-off suspends
TX, settles old hardware requests, and drops incomplete detail. Fresh charger
decisions and a protected bundle are published before TX resumes. CAN errors,
recovery, completion latency and deadline counters remain available in diagnostics.

## ADBMS2950/APM identifiers

### `0x6AE` — APM sample

| Bytes | Field | Encoding |
|---:|---|---|
| 0-1 | Current channel 1 | signed 0.01 A; `INT16_MIN` when invalid |
| 2-3 | Current channel 2 | signed 0.01 A; `INT16_MIN` when invalid |
| 4-5 | VBAT channel 1 | unsigned 0.1 V; `UINT16_MAX` when invalid |
| 6-7 | VBAT channel 2 | unsigned 0.1 V; `UINT16_MAX` when invalid |

### `0x6AF` — APM health

| Byte | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | Flags | initialized, SID valid, config valid, sample valid, current valid, pack-voltage valid, REFUP, snapshot active |
| 1 | Last stage | raw ADBMS2950 driver stage |
| 2 | Last reason | raw ADBMS2950 failure reason |
| 3 | Device ID | expected ADBMS2950B device identifier |
| 4-5 | I1 conversion count | unsigned big-endian |
| 6-7 | Sample age | milliseconds, saturated at 65535 |

### `0x6B0` — APM raw

| Bytes | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| 0-3 | I1 raw | signed raw current code, big-endian representation |
| 4-5 | VB1 raw | signed raw voltage code, big-endian |
| 6 | I1 conversion phase | raw phase/counter state |
| 7 | Calibration profile | DER 100 micro-ohm or EVAL 50 micro-ohm profile enum |

The standalone EVAL image can publish valid APM current while SMB voltage and
temperature authority remain unavailable. That is intentional for isolated
ADBMS2950 bench work and must not be interpreted as complete accumulator safety
readiness.

## Receiver rules

- Treat the live passive range `0x690-0x6C0` as observability only.
- Use `0x6AD` to associate phased detail with a source measurement sequence.
- Preserve invalid sentinels rather than converting them to zero.
- Detect missing phases and sequence stagnation in logger tooling, not in torque
  authority.
- Continue using compact `0x680-0x683` and dynamic power frames for ECU safety
  and torque decisions.


## DER26-CAN-V4 passive extensions

The V4 scheduler adds `0x6B1..0x6BE` without changing the authority boundary:

- `0x6B1`: optional legacy compatibility relocation; disabled in the vehicle build.
- `0x6B2`: estimator diagnostic detail.
- `0x6B3`: TX scheduler/recovery diagnostics.
- `0x6B4`: estimator voltage-product comparison. Byte 0 is the active estimator index; byte 1 carries RAW/AVG8/IIR validity plus the compile-selected estimator source; bytes 2-3 are signed AVG8-minus-RAW mV; bytes 4-5 are signed IIR-minus-RAW mV; bytes 6-7 are the low 16 bits of the measurement sequence.
- `0x6B5..0x6C0`: disposable test-day tuning records documented separately.

`0x6B4` is observational only. RAW C voltage remains the battery-safety voltage source regardless of the estimator-source experiment.
